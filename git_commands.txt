to restore to current GitHub repo:

git add .

git commit -m "added prc-20 support"

git push origin main --force

Prompt:

I'm having trouble pushing to my GitHub repository. I get "Repository not found" and "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent" errors. Here's what I've done:
Verified the remote URL with git remote -v.
Tried adding my SSH key with ssh-add ~/.ssh/deploy_key but got an error.
Checked my SSH connection with ssh -T git@github.com and it says I'm authenticated.
How can I fix these issues to successfully push my changes?

Steps to Resolve:
Start the SSH Agent: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add the SSH Key:   ssh-add ~/.ssh/deploy_key

Verify Remote URL:
Ensure the remote URL is correct and uses SSH: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:martinseeger2002/plugzWallet2.git
Test SSH Connection:  ssh -T git@github.com
Push Changes:   git push origin main --force

This should help you quickly identify and resolve the issues.
